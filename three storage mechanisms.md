There are a few differnet storage methods, the three I considered were JSON, Key Value, and SQLite Database. I eventually decided upon Json due to the flexible structure as well as the game save files could be utilized without modification or changing of the structure that I currently use. I also considered using key values, like key value pairs, it would be good if I was just storing simple integers or simple scores, but it lacks the complexity I need for the type of data I need to save. I also considered using SQLite. SQLite would be useful for recording thousands of records and for centralized file storage, but it isn't necessary for what I need to do. I might one day have a choice SQL server, but even then, it might be easier to update the JSON files and send them instead. 

Altogether this is the better option.
