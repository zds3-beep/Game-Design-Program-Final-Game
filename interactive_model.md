So my final project is going to be a decision/choice game that has several buttons and checks to build a story based on the choices the player makes. The main decisions are going to be what the "hero" must overcome. When they do there is a response in the stats and the three bars that will be included later. The interactions are going to be clicking the buttons as well as the feedback from the stats. 

This interaction model can be used in different parts of my game beacuse at the beginning the player chooses the background of the hero, which affects their stats and beginning features. Then you make several choices to influence the heros story and change the stats and give you advantages or disadvantages for specific challenges. This interactive model can be expanded upon based on the number of features I introduce.
