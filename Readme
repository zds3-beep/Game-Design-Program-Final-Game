Hero’s Fate – Project Proposal
Elevator Pitch
Do you enjoy webtoons or manhwa comics and wish you could make your own choices? Hero’s Fate is an interactive fantasy game that lets you create a hero and guide them through a series of challenges. You decide their path—but beware: a final, uncontrollable showdown awaits. Will your choices be enough?
Game Synopsis
Players begin by selecting one of eight unique backgrounds, each offering distinct advantages and disadvantages. From there, they’re presented with four challenge options at a time. Choosing one triggers a pop-up outcome—good, bad, or close—and then refreshes the choice screen with new scenarios. A visible timer in the upper-right corner tracks how many “months” (or choices) remain. Once time runs out, the hero must face the ultimate test: a climactic battle against the Evil God. The outcome depends entirely on the path the player has forged.
Objective
The goal is to strategically select challenges that build your hero’s stats and prepare them to survive—and triumph over—the final confrontation with the Evil God.
Core Mechanics
Background selection: Determines the hero’s starting stats and traits.
Choice-based progression: Players repeatedly select from four evolving scenarios, each affecting the hero’s development.
Time-limited gameplay: A countdown limits the number of choices, adding pressure and strategy to each decision.
Final encounter: The game culminates in an automatic, high-stakes battle based on the hero’s accumulated stats and choices.
